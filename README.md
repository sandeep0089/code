Preprocessing with Genetic Algorithm
In the preprocessing stage, a genetic algorithm is used to optimize the initial dataset. The genetic algorithm helps in selecting the most relevant features, thereby improving the efficiency and performance of the subsequent learning stages. The steps involved are:

Initialization: Generate an initial population of possible solutions (chromosomes), each representing a subset of features.
Selection: Evaluate the fitness of each chromosome and select the best-performing ones for reproduction.
Crossover: Combine pairs of chromosomes to create a new generation.
Mutation: Introduce random changes to some chromosomes to maintain genetic diversity.
Iteration: Repeat the selection, crossover, and mutation steps until a stopping criterion is met.

Split Learning
Split learning is a collaborative learning technique where the neural network is split between multiple entities. Each entity trains a part of the network on its local data and only shares intermediate results. This method enhances privacy and reduces the computational load on individual participants.

Model Partitioning: Divide the neural network into several segments.
Local Training: Each participant trains their segment on local data and passes intermediate outputs to the next participant.
Aggregation: Collect intermediate outputs, complete the forward and backward propagation, and update the model.

Federated Learning
Federated learning enables multiple entities to collaboratively train a shared model without sharing their local data. Each participant trains the model on their local data and shares the updated model parameters with a central server.

Model Initialization: Initialize a global model on the central server.
Local Training: Each participant trains the model on their local data and sends the updated parameters to the server.
Aggregation: The server aggregates the parameters from all participants to update the global model.
Iteration: Repeat the local training and aggregation steps until convergence.

Split Federated Learning
Split federated learning combines the benefits of split learning and federated learning. This technique allows participants to collaboratively train a model while maintaining data privacy and reducing computational overhead.

Model Partitioning: Divide the neural network into segments and assign them to participants.
Local Training: Each participant trains their segment on local data, similar to split learning.
Parameter Sharing: Participants share the intermediate parameters with a central server.
Aggregation: The server aggregates the parameters and updates the global model.
Iteration: Repeat the local training and aggregation steps until the model converges.

After completion of above tasks, compared the performance of each methodology.
